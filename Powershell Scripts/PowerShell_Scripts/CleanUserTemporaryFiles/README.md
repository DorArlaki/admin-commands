## Script Overview

The script performs the following actions:

- It identifies all user profiles on the computer (excluding "Default" and "Public" profiles).
- For each user profile, it locates and cleans the respective temporary folder (%Temp%).
- It deletes all files from each user's temporary folder while skipping files in use by Windows.
- Errors encountered during cleanup are logged separately for each user in their respective temporary folder.

## Customization

You can customize the script to suit your needs:

- To add additional cleanup steps that apply to all users, you can modify the script where indicated.
- The script currently targets the `%Temp%` folder for each user profile. If you need to target a different folder, you can modify the `$TempPath` variable within the loop.

## Logging

- The script logs any errors encountered during cleanup in a file named `TempCleanupLog.txt` located within each user's temporary folder. This allows you to review errors specific to each user.
