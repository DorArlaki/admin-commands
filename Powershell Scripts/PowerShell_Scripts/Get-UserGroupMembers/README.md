# Get-UserGroupMembers.ps1

## Overview

The "Get-UserGroupMembers.ps1" PowerShell script is designed to `retrieve and store information about user group memberships in a specified domain`. It queries Active Directory to gather data on user accounts and the groups they belong to, and then exports this information to a CSV file. This script is useful for administrators who need to manage and analyze user group memberships within their organization.
